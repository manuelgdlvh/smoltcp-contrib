# SmolTCP Contrib

This repository hosts smoltcp components and experimental features that are not part of the core smoltcp repository.

The contrib repository allows developers to experiment with new functionality, test APIs, and extend smoltcp without affecting the stability of the core library.
Some components here may eventually be promoted to the core repository if they mature, while others may remain experimental.

Users are encouraged to explore and combine components from the core and contrib repositories to build custom network stacks or prototypes. Each component may have its own support and stability level, so some features could be Stable, others Experimental, or Development-only depending on the signal or functionality it provides.
